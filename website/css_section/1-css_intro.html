	<h1>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h1>
		<p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page! HTML was created to describe the content of a web page
		When tags like<xmp> <font> </xmp> and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
		To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
